#what is this#
node and graphdb app to map data and facts.

#but how#
data is entered using object->relation->subject. 

this relationship is saved in the database, along with meta-data. 

the relationships and metadata together can be analysed for patterns, for example if multiple objects has an 'is_a' relation to a subject then it is probably a category. 

accessing the data are saved in the meta data, it is therefore constantly changing.
